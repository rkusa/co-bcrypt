# co-bcrypt

[bcrypt](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/) wrapper for [co](https://github.com/visionmedia/co)

[![NPM][npm]](https://npmjs.org/package/co-bcrypt)

Since **1.0.0**, `co-bcrypt` is using [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/) instead of [`bcryptjs`](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) (a wrapper for bcryptjs: [`co-bcryptjs`](https://github.com/rkusa/co-bcryptjs)).

## Usage

```js
var salt = yield bcrypt.genSalt(10)
var hash = yield bcrypt.hash('B4c0/\/', salt)

if (yield.compare('B4c0/\/', hash)) {
  ...
}
```
